# Kuzzle Plugin S3

S3 has a right system to limit who can upload files to buckets.

[Presigned URLs](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/PresignedUrlUploadObject.html) are special disposable Urls generated by S3. It is possible to upload a file directly to one of these URLs so that it can be stored into the bucket.

These URLs must be generated on the server side, this plugin includes among other things the generation of these URLs so that developers can then send their files directly to S3 from a client application.

## Usage

Get a Presigned URL: 

```javascript
// Kuzzle request
{
  "controller": "s3/upload",
  "action": "getUrl",
  "filename": "headcrab.png",
  "uploadDir": "xen"
}

// Kuzzle response
{
  "fileKey": "xen/<uuid>-headcrab.png",
  "uploadUrl": "https://s3.eu-west-3.amazonaws.com/...",
  "fileUrl": "https://s3.eu-west-3.amazonaws.com/...",
  "ttl": 1200000
}
```

Then send a PUT request to the `uploadUrl` URL with the body set to the file's content and a `Content-Type` header corresponding to the file mime type.  

Finally, validate the uploaded file. If not validated in a timely manner (the TTL is configurable), the uploaded file is automatically removed.

```javascript
// Kuzzle request
{
  "controller": "s3/upload",
  "action": "validate",
  "fileKey": "xen/<uuid>-headcrab.png"
}
```

### Example using the Javascript SDK

```js
  // Get a Presigned URL
  const file = document.getElementById('uploadInput').files[0];
  const { result } = await kuzzle.query({
    controller: 's3/upload',
    action: 'getUrl',
    uploadDir: 'xen',
    filename: file.name
  });

  // Upload the file directly to S3
  const axiosOptions = {
    headers: {
      'Content-Type': file.type
    }
  };
  await axios.put(result.uploadUrl, file, axiosOptions);

  // Validate the uploaded file
  await kuzzle.query({
    controller: 's3/upload',
    action: 'validate',
    fileKey: result.fileKey
  });
```

### API

#### *upload:getUrl*

Returns a Presigned URL to upload directly to S3.  
The URL is only valid for a specified period of time. (Configurable in the [kuzzlerc file](https://docs.kuzzle.io/plugins/1/manual-setup/config/))

File uploaded to the generated URL must be validated with `upload:validate` otherwise they will be deleted after the same TTL as for the URL expiration.

*Request format:*

```javascript
{
  // Kuzzle API params
  "controller": "s3/upload",
  "action": "getUrl",

  // Uploaded file name
  "filename": "headcrab.png", 
  // Upload directory
  "uploadDir": "xen" 
}
```

*Response result format:* 

```javascript
{
  // File key in S3 bucket
  "fileKey": "xen/<uuid>-headcrab.png", 
  // Presigned upload URL
  "uploadUrl": "https://s3.eu-west-3.amazonaws.com/...", 
  // Public file URL after successful upload
  "fileUrl": "https://s3.eu-west-3.amazonaws.com/...", 
  // TTL in ms for the URL validity and before the uploaded file deletion
  "ttl": 1200000 
}
```

#### *upload:validate*

Validate and persist a previsously uploaded file.  
Without a call to the action, every file uploaded on a Presigned URL will be deleted after a TTL.

*Request format:*

```javascript
{
  // Kuzzle API params
  "controller": "s3/upload",
  "action": "validate",

  // File key in S3 bucket
  "fileKey": "xen/<uuid>-headcrab.png" 
}
```

*Response result format:* 

```javascript
{
  // File key in S3 bucket
  "fileKey": "xen/<uuid>-headcrab.png", 
  // Public file URL after successful upload
  "fileUrl": "https://s3.eu-west-3.amazonaws.com/..." 
}
```

#### *file:getUrl*

Returns the public file URL.

*Request format:*

```javascript
{
  // Kuzzle API params
  "controller": "s3/file",
  "action": "getUrl",

  // File key in S3 bucket
  "fileKey": "xen/<uuid>-headcrab.png" 
}
```

*Response result format:* 

```javascript
{
  // Public file URL after successful upload
  "fileUrl": "https://s3.eu-west-3.amazonaws.com/..." 
}
```

#### *file:delete*

Deletes an uploaded file from S3.

*Request format:*

```javascript
{
  // Kuzzle API params
  "controller": "s3/file",
  "action": "delete",

  "fileKey": "xen/<uuid>-headcrab.png" // File key in S3 bucket
}
```

## Configuration

You need to set your AWS access key in the environment: `AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID` and `AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY`.  
Your access key must have the following rights: `PutObject` and `DeleteObject`.  

Then in your `kuzzlerc` file, you can change the following configuration variable:

```js
{
  "plugins": {
    "s3": {
      // AWS S3 bucket
      "bucketName": "your-s3-bucket",
      // AWS S3 region
      "region": "eu-west-3",
      // TTL in ms before Presigned URL expire or the uploaded file is deleted
      "signedUrlTTL": 1200000,
      // Redis key prefix
      "redisPrefix": "s3Plugin/uploads"
    }
  }
}
```


### AWS S3 Bucket

First you must configure your bucket to allow public access to uploaded files.  
Go to the `Permissions` tab in your bucket configuration and in `Bucket Policy` add the following statement:

```json
{
  "Version": "2012-10-17",
  "Statement": [
    {
      "Sid": "AddPerm",
      "Effect": "Allow",
      "Principal": "*",
      "Action": "s3:GetObject",
      "Resource": "arn:aws:s3:::your-bucket-name/*"
    }
  ]
}
```

Then you have to allow Cross Origin Request by editing the CORS Configuration:

```xml
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
<CORSConfiguration xmlns="http://s3.amazonaws.com/doc/2006-03-01/">
<CORSRule>
    <AllowedOrigin>your-app-domain.com</AllowedOrigin>
    <AllowedMethod>GET</AllowedMethod>
    <AllowedMethod>PUT</AllowedMethod>
    <AllowedMethod>POST</AllowedMethod>
    <MaxAgeSeconds>3000</MaxAgeSeconds>
    <AllowedHeader>Content-Type</AllowedHeader>
    <AllowedHeader>Authorization</AllowedHeader>
</CORSRule>
</CORSConfiguration>
```

## Installation

### On an existing Kuzzle stack

Clone this repository in your `plugins/available` directory and then link it to the `plugins/enabled` directory.  

Then go to your plugin directory and run the following command `npm install`.

For more information, refer to the official documentation: https://docs.kuzzle.io/guide/1/essentials/plugins/#installing-a-plugin

### Local setup

You can use the [docker-composer.yml](docker/docker-compose.yml) file provided in this repository to start a Kuzzle stack with this plugin pre-installed.  

You have to provide valid credentials for AWS S3 through the `AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID` and `AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY` environment variables.

```bash
export AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID=your-access-key
export AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY=your-secret-key

docker-compose -f docker/docker-compose.yml up
```

Then you can open the file [test/s3-upload-test.html](test/s3-upload-test.html) in your browser.
