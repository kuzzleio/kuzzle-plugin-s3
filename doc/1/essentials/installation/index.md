# Kuzzle Plugin S3

S3 has a right system to limit who can upload files to buckets.

[Presigned URLs](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/PresignedUrlUploadObject.html) are special disposable Urls generated by S3. It is possible to upload a file directly to one of these URLs so that it can be stored into the bucket.

These URLs must be generated on the server side, this plugin includes among other things the generation of these URLs so that developers can then send their files directly to S3 from a client application.

## Installation

Clone the plugin repository in your `plugins/available` directory and then link it to the `plugins/enabled` directory.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/kuzzleio/kuzzle-plugin-s3 plugins/available/kuzzle-plugin-s3
ln -s ../available/kuzzle-plugin-s3 plugins/enabled/kuzzle-plugin-s3
```

Then go to your plugin directory and run the following command `npm install`.

You can now restart Kuzzle and check [http://localhost:7512](http://localhost:7512), you should see the plugin name under the key `serverInfo.kuzzle.plugins.s3`.

## Plugin configuration

In your `kuzzlerc` file, you can change the following configuration variable:

  - `bucketName`: AWS S3 bucket
  - `region`: AWS S3 region
  - `signedUrlTTL`: TTL in [ms](https://www.npmjs.com/package/ms) format before the presigned URL expires, or before the uploaded file is deleted
  - `redisPrefix`: Redis key prefix
  - `vault.accessKeyIdPath`: Path to the AWS Access key id in the Vault
  - `vault.secretAccessKeyPath`: Path to the AWS secret access key in the Vault

```js
{
  "plugins": {
    "s3": {
      "bucketName": "your-s3-bucket",
      "region": "eu-west-3",
      "signedUrlTTL": "20min",
      "redisPrefix": "s3Plugin/uploads",
      "vault": {
        "accessKeyIdPath": "aws.s3.accessKeyId",
        "secretAccessKeyPath": "aws.s3.secretAccessKey"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

## Credentials

This plugin needs AWS S3 credentials with the `PutObject` and `DeleteObject` permissions.  
 
These credentials can be set in the [Vault](/core/1/guides/essentials/secrets-vault).  

By default the format is the following:
```js
{
  "aws": {
    "s3": {
      "accessKeyId": "accessKeyId",
      "secretAccessKey": "secretAccessKey"
    }
  }
}
```

You can change the path of the credentials used by the plugin by changing the `vault.accessKeyIdPath` and `vault.secretAccessKeyPath` values in the configuration.  

If you cannot use the Vault, it's also possible to set the AWS S3 credentials in the following environment variables:
  - `AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID`
  - `AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY`

Environment variable have precedence over the Vault.

## AWS S3 Bucket configuration

First you must configure your bucket to allow public access to uploaded files.  
Go to the `Permissions` tab in your bucket configuration and in `Bucket Policy` add the following statement:

```json
{
  "Version": "2012-10-17",
  "Statement": [
    {
      "Sid": "AddPerm",
      "Effect": "Allow",
      "Principal": "*",
      "Action": "s3:GetObject",
      "Resource": "arn:aws:s3:::your-bucket-name/*"
    }
  ]
}
```

Then you have to allow Cross Origin Request by editing the CORS Configuration:

```xml
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
<CORSConfiguration xmlns="http://s3.amazonaws.com/doc/2006-03-01/">
<CORSRule>
    <AllowedOrigin>your-app-domain.com</AllowedOrigin>
    <AllowedMethod>GET</AllowedMethod>
    <AllowedMethod>PUT</AllowedMethod>
    <AllowedMethod>POST</AllowedMethod>
    <MaxAgeSeconds>3000</MaxAgeSeconds>
    <AllowedHeader>Content-Type</AllowedHeader>
    <AllowedHeader>Authorization</AllowedHeader>
</CORSRule>
</CORSConfiguration>
```
